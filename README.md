### Here is a python3 program to calculate JEE Mains score.
### Tested On Windows 10 21H1, Python 3.9.6

## Requirements:
-   Python3
-   BeautifulSoup4 Python Module:  
    Open Command Prompt and Run Following Command:  
    ```
    $ pip install bs4 
    ```

## How to Use?

<h3>If you don't want to install Python3 and/or dependencies, you can simply save Response & AnswerKey and run <b>main.exe</b>.<br>
Though this is standalone and doesn't require anything else(except your Response and AnswerKey ofc), it is more prone to errors and running main.py is recommended.
